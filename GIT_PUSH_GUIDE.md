# How to Push Your Updates to GitHub

## Step 1: Check Current Status
First, see what files have been changed:

```bash
git status
```

## Step 2: Stage Your Changes
Add all the modified files to the staging area:

```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Or add specific files if you prefer:
git add src/services/projectService.ts
git add src/utils/urlMigration.test.ts
git add src/services/documentsService.ts
git add src/services/milestonesService.ts
git add src/services/interactionsService.ts
git add src/services/teamsIntegrationService.ts
git add src/components/common/GlobalSearchBar.tsx
git add src/components/dashboard/ProjectPipeline.tsx
git add src/components/dashboard/AdvancedProjectPipeline.tsx
git add src/utils/navigation.test.ts
git add tests/e2e/legacyUrlRedirects.spec.ts
git add tests/e2e/clientProjectNavigation.spec.ts
git add tests/e2e/breadcrumbNavigation.spec.ts
```

## Step 3: Commit Your Changes
Create a commit with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: implement client-centric navigation and URL migration

- Update navigation utilities to support client-project URL structure
- Add comprehensive URL migration system for legacy project URLs
- Implement Teams integration notifications with proper navigation URLs
- Update dashboard components to use new navigation patterns
- Add extensive test coverage for navigation and URL migration
- Create E2E tests for legacy URL redirects and breadcrumb navigation
- Enhance global search with proper navigation integration"
```

## Step 4: Push to GitHub
Push your changes to the remote repository:

```bash
# If you're on the main branch:
git push origin main

# If you're on a different branch:
git push origin your-branch-name

# If this is your first push and you need to set upstream:
git push -u origin main
```

## Alternative: Create a Feature Branch
If you want to create a feature branch for these changes:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/client-navigation-system

# Stage and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement client-centric navigation and URL migration"

# Push the new branch
git push -u origin feature/client-navigation-system
```

## Step 5: Verify on GitHub
After pushing, you can:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Check that your changes appear in the commit history
3. If you created a feature branch, consider creating a Pull Request

## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
```bash
# Configure your Git credentials if needed
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# If using HTTPS, you may need a personal access token
# If using SSH, ensure your SSH key is set up
```

### If you get merge conflicts:
```bash
# Pull the latest changes first
git pull origin main

# Resolve any conflicts, then:
git add .
git commit -m "resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin main
```

### If you need to see what will be pushed:
```bash
# See the diff of what will be committed
git diff --staged

# See the commit history
git log --oneline -10
```
